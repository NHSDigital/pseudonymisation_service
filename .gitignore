# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore rubocop caches
/.rubocop-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/storage/*
!/storage/.keep
.byebug_history

# Ignore database config, even though secrets will be elsewhere;
# we have toolchains that just expect this file to not exist.
/config/database.yml

# Ignore master credentials + key. We explicitly keep the .enc file
# out of version control too, on account of its contents.
/config/credentials.yml.enc
/config/master.key

# Ignore production user credential hash file, and any backups:
/config/userlist.yml*
